# Advent Of Code 2025 Solution Bank 🎄
There were unfortunately only 12 (2-part) questions in the 2025 version of Advent of Code, but I have included all my solutions to them here, along with comments where necessary. 

NB: I can't be asked to move stuff into sub-folders, so you're going to have to deal with the text and Python files in the same place.
